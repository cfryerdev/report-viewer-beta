## Is there a live version?

Absolutely, check it out here: https://reportviewer.artillery.io/

## Can I host this locally in my own cloud?

Absolutely, we have a docker image published to dockerhub specifically for this purpose. Check it out: [cfryerdev/artilleryio-report-viewer](https://hub.docker.com/r/cfryerdev/artilleryio-report-viewer)

## How can I customize my docker image? 

There are a number of environment variables you can set:
```
LOADER_ENABLED=true
LOADER_ENFORCEWHITELIST=true
WHITELIST_PROTOCOLS=https,http
WHITELIST_HOSTS=**.blob.core.windows.net,**.s3-**.amazonaws.com
RATELIMITER_ENABLED=true
RATELIMITER_IP_HITS_PER_MINUTES=100
RATELIMITER_MINUTES=10
```

# Getting Started
You can run this locally in three modes:

Debug (next+react)
```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Production mode (nextjs+express+react)
```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

or via docker, see below...

## How do I generate json reports?

When you run the artillery cli, you can simply add the following to your command to output a json file for use with this tool: `-o some_report.json`

## Serverside, Express, & React
This project uses NextJS in a typescript configuration to host React and serve up the react web application server-side via expressjs. This allows us to do clientside rendering and serverside rendering, as well as cache renderings to increase the performance of the application.
